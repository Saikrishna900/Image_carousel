Project Title: Image Carousel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Project Description:

The Image Carousel is a common and essential component of modern websites that provides an interactive and engaging way to showcase multiple images on a webpage. In this project, we will create a simple but elegant Image Carousel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Image Carousel will have the following features:

    Automatic Slideshow: The Image Carousel will have an automatic slideshow feature that allows images to transition smoothly from one to another at a specific interval.

    Manual Navigation: The user can manually navigate through the images by clicking the previous and next buttons or the corresponding navigation dots at the bottom of the carousel.

    Pause/Play Button: The automatic slideshow can be paused and resumed by clicking the Pause/Play button.

    Responsive Design: The Image Carousel will be designed with a responsive layout, ensuring that it looks great and functions well on different screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The implementation of this project will involve the following steps:

    Creating a basic HTML structure for the Image Carousel, including the images and navigation elements.

    Styling the HTML elements using CSS, including the layout, fonts, colors, and effects.

    Implementing the JavaScript logic for the automatic slideshow, manual navigation, and pause/play button.

    Testing and debugging the Image Carousel to ensure that it works as expected.

Overall, the Image Carousel project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent opportunity to enhance your web development skills and create a useful and interactive feature for your website.
